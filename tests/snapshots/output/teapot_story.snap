    <h2>Why Can't Teapots Brew Coffee?</h2>
    <p>
        It's not stubbornness—teapots just aren't built for coffee. They're
        designed for tea: the shape, materials, spout, everything. Asking a
        teapot to brew coffee is like asking a violin to play drums—wrong tool
        for the job.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        When you try to make a teapot brew coffee, the only reasonable response
        is <strong class="highlight">I'm a teapot</strong>. It's not really an
        error—more like a proud declaration of identity. 🫖
