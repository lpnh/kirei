{#- This is the basic layout of our example application. It is the core skeleton shared between all pages. It expects the struct of any template that `{% extends %}` this layout to contain (at least) a field `lang: Lang`, so it can be used in the `<html lang=` attribute. -#}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ lang }}">
    <head>
        {#- A base template can contain `blocks`, which my be overridden templates that use this base template. A block may contain a default content, if the extending template does want to / need to override the content of a block. E.g. maybe you would like to have "Askama example application" as default title for your pages, then simply add this text (without quotation marks) in the block! The default content can be as complex as you need it to be. E.g. it may contain any nodes like `{% if … %}`, and even other blocks. ~#}
        <title>
            {% block title %}
            {% endblock %}
        </title>
        {#- In a real application you most likely would want to link style sheets, any JavaScripts etc. using e.g. `actix-files`, instead of embedding the content in your generated HTML. As you can see, this comment starts with `-`, which will tells the comment to strip all white spaces before it, until it finds the first non-white space character, a `>`. The comment is also terminated with `~`. This also strips white spaces, but will leave one space, or a newline character, if the stripped content contained a newline. ~#}
