            {#-   
                    A base template can contain `blocks`, which my be overridden templates that use   
                       this base template. A block may contain a default content, if the extending
                     template does want to / need to override the content of a block.

                    E.g. maybe you would like to have "Askama example application" as default title for   
                              your pages, then simply add this text (without quotation marks) in the block!

                     The default content can be as complex as you need it to be.
                    E.g. it may contain any nodes like `{% if â€¦ %}`, and even other blocks.
